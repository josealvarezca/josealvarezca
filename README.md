I am a cybersecurity apprentice from Venezuela with five years of experience as a manual QA tester. I have a profound interest in technology and a strong dedication to solving complex problems.

## Objective

I am excited to transition into cybersecurity after discovering a passion for it during my years in IT. My goal is to work as a Tier 1 Analyst in a Security Operations Center (SOC) or as a Pentester.
